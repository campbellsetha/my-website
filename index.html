    <h2>My name is Seth Campbell</h2>
    <p>I am currently deciding what I want my website to be about. Currently I am considering the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dog Training</li>
        <li>Animal Rescue</li>
        <li>The how-to's of home buying and selling</li>
        <li>Community watch board</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While you wait for the website to get up an running please enjoy this picture of the most happy dog <br>
    in the world! Her name is Rue and she likes to watch me study.</p>
