                <p>My name is Seth Campbell. This is my fifth quarter at Olympic college. I did three quarters as a part-time student
                    back in 2020 and started full-time this last winter term. I'm persuing my degree in IT-Cybersecurity (AAS) and finishing
                    my transfer credit requirements for my Computer Science Degree (BS). I plan on transfering to Univeristy of Washington
                    Tacoma Campus in the fall. Prior to starting as a full-time student I did 11 years in the Navy serving on Submarines.
                    I'm looking forward practicing some HTML and CSS again and honing my UX/UI design skills. It wasn't something I got 
                    to do alot when I did a Coding Bootcamp in 2022. <br><br>
                    We are currently trying to sell our house in Allyn and move to Port Orchard. (Link <a href="https://www.zillow.com/myzillow/yourhome/81845592">here</a>) We've been playing around with different color schemes
                    for the new house and each for this website is a variation on color schemes we've been debating on.

                <p>This website is going to serve as a community board for various sections for the McCormick Communities in Port Ochard.
                    Challanges I anticipate to encounter with this task:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using unique and fresh ideas that don't repeat themselves. </li><br>
                        <li>Mimicing database functionality to bring the website to life</li><br>
                        <li>Attempting to bring other functionality to the site (ie. map pins)</li><br>
                        <li>Use photos that are not already used by existing websites representing the community.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Her name is Rue and she's just over two years old years old. She's very playful, incredibly sweet, and sooo 
                    gentle.
