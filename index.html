        <h2>My name is Seth Campbell</h2>
        <p>I am currently deciding what I want my website to be about. I am considering the following ideas:</p>
        <section class="website-ideas">
            <ul>
                <li>Dog Training</li>
                <li>Animal Rescue</li>
                <li>The how-to's of home buying and selling</li>
                <li>Community watch board</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <p>While you wait for the website to get up an running please enjoy this picture of the most happy dog <br>
            in the world! Her name is Rue, here she is watching me study.</p>
