            <h1>--About My Site--</h1>
            <p>This site serves as a community post board for the McCormick Housing Communties. It was also an attempt to play with some new designs including custom McCormick logo using ChatGPT 4o and GIMP photo editing. </p>

            <p>My name is Seth Campbell. This is my fifth quarter at Olympic college. I did three quarters as a part-time student
                back in 2020 and started full-time this last winter term. I'm persuing my degree in IT-Cybersecurity (AAS) and finishing
                my transfer credit requirements for my Computer Science Degree (BA). I plan on transfering to Univeristy of Washington
                Tacoma Campus in the fall. Prior to starting as a full-time student I did 11 years in the Navy serving on Submarines.
                I'm looking forward practicing some HTML and CSS again and honing my UX/UI design skills. It wasn't something I got 
                to do alot when I did a Coding Bootcamp in 2022. <br><br>
                We are currently trying to sell our house in Allyn and move to Port Orchard. (Link <a href="https://www.zillow.com/myzillow/yourhome/81845592">here</a>) 
                We've been playing around with different color schemes for the new house and each for this website is a variation on color schemes we've been debating on.
